# Assuming you already have the code for analyzing links using Bayesian analysis

# Adjust the classification threshold
threshold = 0.3  # Set your desired threshold value

# Iterate through the links and classify them
for link in links:
    spam_probability = analyze_link_with_bayesian(link)  # Perform Bayesian analysis on the link
    if spam_probability < threshold:
        # The link is classified as legitimate (not spam)
        print("Legitimate link:", link)
    else:
        # The link is classified as spam
        print("Potential spam link:", link)
In this example, the threshold variable represents the threshold value for the spam probability. Links with a spam probability below the threshold are classified as legitimate, while links with a spam probability equal to or above the threshold are classified as potential spam.

By setting the threshold to a lower value (e.g., 0.3), you prioritize reducing false negatives, as more links will be classified as legitimate. However, this may also increase the chances of false positives (legitimate links being classified as spam).

You can experiment with different threshold values to find the balance that works best for your specific application and requirements.
